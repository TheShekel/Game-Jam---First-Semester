Hello!

This is a project made by me and some fellow students during our first semester game jam on our Master's Course in Games Programming.

To play, download the build as a ZIP file or as base code, then double click "GameJam ERA 2.exe" to play.

The controls are W + S/Up and Down arrows to move your spaceship up and down, and spacebar to fire projectiles at incoming enemy ships.

The goal of the game is to get a high score. To fail, you must collide three times with enemy ships.

Enjoy!
